## Core concepts

FIRST HALF (12.00 - 13.30)

1. The 2 types of websites: static vs. dynamic

 - Explanation
  Static websites usually come with a fixed number of pages that have a specific layout. When the page runs on a browser, the content is literally static and doesnâ€™t change in response to user actions. A static website is usually created with HTML and CSS 
  Compared to static websites, which are purely informational, a dynamic website is more functional. It allows users to interact with the information that is listed on the page. Of course, that requires utilizing more than just HTML code.
  
  - Example
    Examples the two different kind of websites
  Static: https://www.atlassian.com/time-wasting-at-work-infographic
  Dynamic: https://www.facebook.com/
  
  -Exercise

2. The pillars of web development: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - Explanation
  HTML defines what the content is.
  CSS defines the appearance of the page.
  JavaScript defines behavior of the page.
  - Example
    An example about relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript using a methaphor of building a city: https://blog.codeanalogies.com/2018/05/09/the-relationship-between-html-css-and-javascript-explained/
  - Exercise
  
  - Essence
  Up until now at HackYourFuture, we have been writing websites using HTML and CSS. Even though a website written with these two languages works just fine, it is only a static page. These static pages can interact with a visitor only through the use of forms. Once a form is filled out and submitted, a request is sent back to the server where a new static web page is constructed and eventually downloaded into the browser. The big disadavantage of web pages like this is that the only way that a visitor has of interacting with the page is by filling out the form and waiting for a new page to load. It doesn't exhibit any dynamic behaviour like:

reacting to user actions such as mouse click events or key presses.
rendering complex animations
sending requests over network to servers and fetching a response
And this is where JavaScript steps in.
